This is the repository for my study adventure, as I teleport into the World of Python. My portal of choice is the 'Python Crash Course'. A vast trove of treasure awaits me on this jouney of no return. But I am ready to plunge in this vast chasm of bliss.
This repository contains two directories.
Namely:
1. python_work
2. python_tryouts

python work - contains the solutions to the 'TRY IT YOURSELF' sections of the book. This is where I think out loud, in an attempt to tame the beast of curiousity that lies in the bowels of my mind.

python_tryouts - in this directory, I follow through the examples of the book. Not just reading the book but also typing and running code to confirm the accuracy of the material before me. 

With every passing keystroke of writing python code, I look back at the perils the kraken disguised as a programming language, C ,took me through. Ransacking my mind and making me question my existence. C my bitter ex, I will be back for you. You can't have the last laugh. For now, allow me to enjoy my new lover. Python, my mind is a bed of roses. I await your warm embrace.

Hold my hand, and journey with me on this adventure of love.
